# ab-architect — System / component design

## Purpose

Design before code. For anything non-trivial, produce a design artifact (in chat, not `.md`) that:
- Names the components and their responsibilities
- States the invariants that must hold
- Shows the data flow
- Names the failure modes and how they're handled
- Identifies cross-cutting concerns (auth, tenancy, logging, secrets, rate limits)

Bad architecture is discovered at 2am in production. This skill shifts that discovery to 2 minutes before writing the first line of code.

## When to use

- Any new feature ≥ `medium` scope
- Any change that adds a new component, service, or data store
- Any change that crosses module / repo boundaries
- Any change that touches auth, payments, tenant isolation, or data migrations
- When the user asks "how should I build X?"

## When NOT to use

- Single-file changes
- Bug fixes where the fix location is obvious
- Refactors within one module
- When the design already exists in `.platform/architecture.md` or a past decision

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Scope the design question

Write the design question in one sentence:
> "How should the webhook handler receive Stripe events, persist them idempotently, and fan out to the order state machine without blocking the HTTP response?"

If you can't write it in one sentence, split it into two designs.

### Step 2 — Read the relevant prior art

Parallel probes:
- `Read` `.platform/architecture.md` (if present) for the current topology
- `Read` `.platform/memory/decisions.md` for prior decisions in the area
- `Grep` for similar existing patterns in the codebase
- Read the 3–5 most relevant source files

Time budget: 10 minutes. If it takes longer, the area is under-documented — flag it.

### Step 3 — Produce the design (in chat)

Use exactly this structure:

```
## Design: <one-sentence question>

### Components
1. <Component A> — <responsibility, 1 sentence>
2. <Component B> — <responsibility>
3. ...

### Data flow
<ASCII diagram or numbered steps showing how data moves between components>

### Invariants (must always hold)
1. <Invariant 1 — state it as a testable assertion>
2. <Invariant 2>
3. ...

### Failure modes
| Failure | Detection | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| <Component A fails> | <how we know> | <what happens> |
| <Component B fails> | <how we know> | <what happens> |

### Cross-cutting concerns
- **Auth:** <where it's enforced>
- **Tenant isolation:** <how it's maintained>
- **Logging:** <what's logged, what isn't>
- **Secrets:** <where they live, how they're loaded>
- **Rate limiting / backpressure:** <if applicable>

### Files to create / modify
- `<path>` — <what goes there>
- `<path>` — <what goes there>

### Tests needed
- Happy path: <scenario>
- Failure mode A: <scenario>
- Failure mode B: <scenario>
- Boundary: <scenario>

### What I considered and rejected
1. <Alternative 1> — rejected because <reason>
2. <Alternative 2> — rejected because <reason>

### Open questions for the user
1. <question, only if it blocks the design>
```

### Step 4 — Get approval

Post the design in chat. Ask the user to confirm or revise. **Do not** write the design to a `.md` file. The design is a chat artifact that becomes code and tests — and, if the decision is load-bearing, a row in `.platform/memory/decisions.md`.

### Step 5 — Record the decision (if load-bearing)

If the design locks in a choice that will bite future sessions if forgotten, append to `.platform/memory/decisions.md`:
```
| N | YYYY-MM-DD | locked | <topic> | <decision> | <why> | <rejected: list> |
```

## Output format

See Step 3 — that IS the output format. Markdown, structured, in chat.

Length target: 150–400 lines of chat. Longer means over-designed, shorter means under-designed.

## Red flags — stop and ask

- **You can't name the invariants.** If the design has no invariants, it has nothing to protect.
- **The failure mode table has empty "recovery" cells.** Every failure needs a recovery, even if the recovery is "crash loudly and page the human".
- **The design touches auth / payments / tenant isolation without a cross-cutting concerns section filled in.** High-risk — do not proceed.
- **You rejected zero alternatives.** If there were no alternatives, the design is the only possible solution and probably trivial — you don't need this skill.
- **The design says "we'll figure it out at runtime".** Stop. That's not a design.

## Hard rules

1. **Design in chat, not in `.md`.** No `DESIGN.md`, no `ARCHITECTURE-feature-x.md`.
2. **State invariants as testable assertions.** "The balance is never negative" is testable. "The system is consistent" is not.
3. **Every failure mode has a recovery.** No silent failures.
4. **Cross-cutting concerns are explicit.** Auth, tenancy, logging, secrets — every design covers these even if the answer is "N/A for this design".
5. **Rejected alternatives are listed.** At least 1. If there's truly only one way, say so.

## Integration

- **Upstream:** called by `ab-workflow` Stage 4 for medium+ tasks, or directly when the user asks for a design
- **Inputs:** `.platform/architecture.md`, `.platform/memory/decisions.md`, existing source files
- **Outputs:** chat artifact (the design), optional row in `.platform/memory/decisions.md`
- **Downstream:** feeds execution and `ab-test-writer` (which reads the "Tests needed" section)

## Anti-patterns

1. **Designing the whole system** when the task is one feature. Scope the design to the change.
2. **Skipping failure modes.** "It won't fail" is not a failure mode.
3. **Writing pseudocode in the design.** Design names components and flows, not lines of code.
4. **Over-generalizing.** Design for the current task + one reasonable extension, not for every hypothetical future need.
5. **Silent cross-cutting concerns.** If auth is "implicit" in your design, you haven't designed it.
