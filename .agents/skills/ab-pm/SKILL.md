# ab-pm — Product thinking

## Purpose

Stop features that shouldn't exist. Shape features that should. Before a single line of code is written for a new feature, run it through the PM gate so you're not building something clever that nobody needs.

This skill is **not** product discovery. It's a forcing function for the solo developer / agent to ask the questions a PM would ask if one were in the room.

## When to use

- User asks for a new feature larger than `small`
- User asks "should I build X?"
- You're about to spend more than a day of work on something
- You're about to add a new dependency, service, or data model
- You're about to refactor something that users currently rely on

## When NOT to use

- Bug fixes (the problem is already defined)
- Chores (tooling, config)
- Explicit user instruction ("don't overthink it, just build X")
- Internal refactors with no user-visible effect

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Ask the six forcing questions

Answer each in 1–3 sentences. If you can't answer, ask the user.

1. **Who is the user?** Name them by role. "Restaurant owner onboarding their first location" is good. "Users" is not.
2. **What problem does this solve?** Phrase it as the user's pain, not the feature name. "Onboarding takes 40 minutes and owners drop off at the menu step" is good. "We need a bulk menu import" is not.
3. **What's the simplest version that validates the assumption?** The MVP. Strip everything that isn't load-bearing. If you can't name a v0, the idea isn't ready.
4. **What happens if we don't build this?** Be honest. Sometimes the answer is "nothing". That's a valid answer.
5. **What are the failure modes if we build it wrong?** Top 2–3. "Users get confused and file support tickets" is a failure mode. "The feature doesn't work" is not — that's just a bug.
6. **What would [industry leader] do here?** Pick a relevant comparable (Shopify, Stripe, Linear, Notion, etc. based on the domain). What does their solution look like? Why?

### Step 2 — Decide

Output one of three verdicts:

**BUILD** — clear user, clear problem, clear v0, manageable failure modes. Proceed to `ab-workflow` with the v0 scope.

**RESHAPE** — valid problem but the proposed solution is wrong-sized. Propose a smaller v0 or a different approach. Return to user for confirmation.

**KILL** — no clear user, no real problem, or the "don't build" cost is near-zero. Tell the user why. Be honest.

### Step 3 — Record the decision

If the verdict is BUILD or RESHAPE and the project has a `.platform/memory/decisions.md`, append a row:

```
| N | YYYY-MM-DD | locked | <feature> | <v0 shape> | <why> | <what was considered and rejected> |
```

If KILL, append to `.platform/memory/log.md`:
```
YYYY-MM-DD — PM kill: <feature> — <one-sentence why> — <what to do instead, if anything>
```

## Output format

```
## PM review: <feature name>

1. User: Restaurant owner setting up their first location
2. Problem: Onboarding drops 40% at the menu import step because entering 50 items takes 45 min
3. v0: CSV import with 5 required columns, no validation UI — user fixes errors in their CSV and re-uploads
4. Don't-build cost: We continue to bleed 40% of signups at the menu step; CAC × 0.4 = $X lost per signup attempt
5. Failure modes:
   a. CSV format is too strict and users can't produce it → mitigate: accept loose format, coerce where safe
   b. Errors are unclear → mitigate: line-number-based error report on re-upload
6. Comparable: Shopify's product CSV importer — loose format, clear error lines, re-upload loop

Verdict: BUILD
v0 scope: CSV upload endpoint + validator + line-error response. No UI polish. No progress bar. Done in 1 day.
```

## Red flags — kill the feature

- **You can't name the user** → KILL
- **The "problem" is a developer problem, not a user problem** ("the code is ugly") → KILL (or refile as a refactor)
- **The v0 has more than 5 bullet points** → RESHAPE (v0 is too big)
- **The "don't build" cost is "nothing really"** → KILL
- **You're excited about the tech, not the problem** → KILL or refile as a spike

## Integration

- **Upstream:** called by `ab-workflow` Stage 2 for feature tasks, or directly by the user for "should I build X"
- **Downstream:** feeds `ab-workflow` Stage 4 (propose) with a scoped v0, or exits with KILL

## Anti-patterns

1. **Answering the questions with mush** ("users will love this") — name the user, name the pain.
2. **Skipping the kill verdict** because it feels unhelpful — a kill is the most helpful verdict when it's right.
3. **Building v2 before v0 is shipped** — every "what about later?" goes in `decisions.md` as deferred, not in the v0.
4. **Copying a competitor's solution without asking why theirs looks that way** — understand the constraint, don't cargo-cult.
