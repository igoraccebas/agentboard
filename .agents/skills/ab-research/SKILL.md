# ab-research — Bounded research

## Purpose

Get just enough context to propose a credible plan without burning tokens on an open-ended search. The research budget is deliberately small: if you can't answer the question within the budget, the question is wrong — refine it or ask the user.

## When to use

- Before proposing a plan for `medium` or larger tasks (Stage 3 of `ab-workflow`)
- When you hit an unfamiliar library / framework / pattern mid-execution
- When the user asks "research X" explicitly
- When existing code paths are suspiciously empty or the domain is unclear

## When NOT to use

- Trivial tasks (just execute)
- Questions the user could answer in one sentence (ask them)
- Curiosity / exploration without a specific output (use `Explore` agent instead)
- When the answer is already in `.platform/memory/decisions.md` or `conventions/` (read that first, free)

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Frame the question (1 minute)

Write the research question as a single sentence in chat. Example:
> "What's the idiomatic way to validate webhook signatures with library X on Node 20?"

If you can't write it in one sentence, the question is too vague. Narrow it.

### Step 2 — Check free sources first

Before spending budget, grep for free answers:
```
Grep "<key term>" in .platform/memory/decisions.md, .platform/conventions/, .platform/memory/log.md
```

If the answer is there, you're done. Emit the finding + source and exit.

### Step 3 — Fire all probes in parallel (strict budget)

In **one round** of parallel tool calls:

- **Code probe:** `Grep` for 2–3 key symbols in the project source tree, `Read` the top 3–5 matches
- **Web probe:** exactly 1 `WebSearch` with a precise query
- **Docs probe:** up to 3 `WebFetch` calls for the most promising results from the web search (or directly for known doc URLs)

**Hard budget ceiling:** 1 search + 3 fetches + 5 reads. If you blow the budget, stop and synthesize what you have.

### Step 4 — Synthesize in ≤300 words

Structure:
```
Question: <the one-sentence question>

Answer: <1–3 sentences, direct, with a caveat if applicable>

Evidence:
- <source 1 + what it said, 1 line>
- <source 2 + what it said, 1 line>
- <source 3 + what it said, 1 line>

Caveats / unknowns: <1–2 bullets, only if real>

Recommendation: <what this means for the proposed plan, 1–2 sentences>
```

**Emit in chat.** Do not write a `.md` file. Do not write a "research report". The synthesis IS the deliverable.

### Step 5 — Exit with a clear signal

End your chat message with one of:
- `Research: done. Ready to propose.`
- `Research: inconclusive. Recommend <narrower question> OR user clarification.`
- `Research: blocked. Need user to answer: <question>.`

## Output format

```
Question: What's the idiomatic way to validate Stripe webhook signatures in Python 3.12?

Answer: Use `stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, secret)`. It handles replay protection and timing-safe comparison internally. Do not validate manually.

Evidence:
- Stripe Python docs (stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures) — construct_event is the recommended API, handles timestamp tolerance default 5min
- stripe-python v9.0.0 changelog — construct_event is stable since v2, no deprecation
- Grep in codebase — no existing webhook handlers to match style with

Recommendation: Use construct_event. Reject if it raises. Log the event ID but not the payload. Match the pattern in conventions/security.md §webhooks if that section exists.

Research: done. Ready to propose.
```

## Red flags — stop and ask

- **Question is unanswerable with public info** (internal system details, proprietary APIs) → ask the user
- **Three web fetches contradict each other** → flag it and ask user which to trust
- **Codebase probe finds a pattern the user said doesn't exist** → flag it, they may be wrong
- **Doc fetches all 404 or return JS-rendered pages** → try 1 alternate search, then escalate

## Hard rules

1. **Budget ceiling: 1 search + 3 fetches + 5 reads.** Not 2 searches. Not 4 fetches.
2. **Synthesis ≤ 300 words.** If longer, you're copy-pasting instead of synthesizing.
3. **Never write a research `.md` file.** The synthesis is chat output.
4. **Parallelize.** All probes fire in one round.
5. **Cite sources.** Every claim in the synthesis traces to an evidence bullet.

## Integration

- **Upstream:** called by `ab-workflow` Stage 3, or directly by the user
- **Downstream:** feeds `ab-workflow` Stage 4 (propose) with the context needed for the plan
- **Sibling:** if research reveals a product-level question, hand off to `ab-pm`. If it reveals a security question, hand off to `ab-security`.

## Anti-patterns

1. **Research-as-procrastination.** 5 fetches in, no plan forming — STOP, force a synthesis with what you have.
2. **Answering your own question without citing.** Every answer needs an evidence trail.
3. **Copy-pasting documentation into the synthesis.** Synthesize in your own words, cite the source.
4. **Writing "research notes" files.** Chat only.
